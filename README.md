## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Dart SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The major new tech I utilized in this project was SASS, which I hadn't worked with before.

I really like how it lets you break up your CSS into partials (similar to CSS modules). 
I also found the mixin feature super useful! 

During the project I also made sure to utilize the figma file which helped me get things pretty close to the design. 

### Continued development

I want to continue to use SASS if i'm not using a component based framework, as it seems like a great way to add on to vanilla CSS. I'd like to test it against Tailwind, which I've used very sparingly. 


### Useful resources

- [Learn Sass in 20 minutes by 'developedbyed'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6eOVaaelI) - This was a straightforward intro to using sass and covered the basics really quickly!

### AI Collaboration

I utilized Claude code when I got stuck working on this project. 

This primarily helped me with some layout structures, and advised me on how to use flex-basis when the content div's padding was causing it to take up more than 50% of the card in the desktop style.
